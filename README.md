### Overview

This code provides the algorithms to infer the **latent initial conditions** from a sequence of **aggregate noisy observations** of a dynamical systems.

For details, see Kolic, B., Sabuco, J., & Farmer, J. D. (2022). [Estimating initial conditions for dynamical systems with incomplete information](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-022-07365-y). Nonlinear Dynamics

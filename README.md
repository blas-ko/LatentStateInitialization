## Overview

This code provides the algorithms to infer the **latent initial conditions** from a sequence of **aggregate noisy observations** of a dynamical system.

For details, see our paper [Estimating initial conditions for dynamical systems with incomplete information](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-022-07365-y), published in *Nonlinear Dynamics (2022)*.

## Usage

Check the `/example` folder and the [`LorenzSystemInitialization.ipynb`](https://github.com/blas-ko/LatentStateInitialization/blob/main/example/LorenzSystemInitialization.ipynb) notebook within for a tutorial on how to use the code.
